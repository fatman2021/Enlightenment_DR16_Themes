2. Download and install AISS (Enlightenment iconbar uses AISS) - http://www.masonicons.info/aiss/index.html
3. Enlightenment/User Menus/Themes - select "aosx11"
4. Enlightenment/Desktop Background Settings - select "X11_1024x768.png" or "X11_1280x1024.png"

Maybe Mason create additional AISS images (ToolbarImages/Contrib/) for X11?
Default Amiga X11 theme? Maybe CygnusEd include this theme in next update X11?
